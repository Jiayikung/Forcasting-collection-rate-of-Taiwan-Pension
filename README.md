## Summary
Taiwan's National Pension Insurance (NPI) is a compulsory defined benefit pension insurance scheme; however, the collection rate of NPI has fallen below 50% since January 2019.. This study aims to analyze the impact of four key macroeconomic factors on the collection rate of NPI and accordingly predict future trends based on one of these factors. Using time-series data from 2008 to 2021, the study employs a multiple regression model to determine the most influential macroeconomic variable on collection rates. Next, we utilize Bayesian estimation model to forecast future collection rates, providing valuable insights into future trends and potential outcome. The results indicate that the monthly economic growth rate is the most influential factor, with a 65% probability that higher economic growth leads to lower collection rates. These findings shed light on a negative relationship between economic growth and NPI collection rate, highlighting an inherent issue concerning the lack of engagement and motivation within the policy.

The study is as follows. Section 1 mentions background information and Literature Reviews. Section 2 describes the data and sample. Section 3 outlines the multiple regression model and the Bayesian estimation model. Section 4 concludes.
